# K-means-cluster
Finland Geographical Data

Only requirements for the code to run are the two geography data files, `FinlandWhole.txt` and `JoensuuRegion.txt`.

The code initializes centroids smartly by choosing centroids far apart and spread out across the data, inspired by [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HatwtJSsj5Q). The method is to randomly choose the first centroid, and choose the next centroid to be the data point with the largest minimum distance to previous centroids. Note that this method does not guarantee that all centroids are initialized in different cluster. It is possible to have two centroids initialized in the same cluster if the cluster is widespread enough and the two centroids are far apart. For this project, the simple fix is to run the code multiple times until it does initialize all centroids in different clusters. 

The number of `ITERATIONS` is set to 10 since that was enough for convergence. For each dataset, "Finland" and "Joensuu Region", the code plots the cluster results (`_cluster.png`), mean cluster distance (MCD) for k=4 over iterations (`_mcd.png`), and MCD for various kâ€™s (`_variousk.png`). I chose to test for k values [4, 8, 12, 20].
